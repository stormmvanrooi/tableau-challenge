<h1>Insights from CitiBike Data</h1>

- The most popular start and end stations are in Manhattan. This suggests that most users are taking short rides and staying in the same boroughs. The least popular start and end stations are outside of the city which suggests that most riders do not use CitiBikes for daily commutes.

- The longest rides are taken by users in the Gen X (1965-1980) age and the shortest rides are taken by WW II (1923-1927). The most likely reason is due to age. 

- We are also seeing that Post War ride duration drops dramatically from 2019 to 2020 (1928-1945). This could also be attributed to age but it could also be attributed to quarantining due to COVID-19. If individuals are quarantining more and only traveling to places near their home, the use of bikes would drop. 

- There are a substantial amount more subscribers than customers. However, Gen Xers make up most of the customers and Millenials make up most of the subscribers. This could indicate that the subscriber model is geared more towards younger generations. This could be an opportunity for marketing to convert GenX customers to subscribers.
